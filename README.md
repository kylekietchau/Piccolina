# Piccolina

A Discord chat bot that uses the OpenAI assistant API in order to receive and generate prompts from the user on Discord. Gathers and stores information about the user's prompts and stores them in a file to be used as relevant information for future conversations.


## In Progress:
		1. Migrate the contextual information for future conversations from a local file to MongoDB.
		2. Create unique context files for different users.
		3. Use NLP to fully optimize the contextual information gathered from the user.
